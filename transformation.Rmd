> Create new variables, summaries, rename variables or reorder observations
*Examples are NYC departure flights 2013*, [source](www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0)

### 4.1 nycflights14
```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
flights
```
`View(flights)`,shows you the entire dataset like excel in viewer.
```{r}
class(flights)
```
- It prints diff coz it has diff class from usual dataframes.
- tbl\_df *tibble diff* or data\_frame
- `as.data_frame()` converts to tbl_df
- To create new tbl\_df from individual vectors,use data\_frame() eg
`data_frame(x=1:3, y=c("a", "b", "c"))`
- Subseting tbl\_df with [ always returns a tbl\_df, contrary to other that may give a vector.
- To extract a single column, use [[ or $.

### 4.2 dplyr verbs
- 5 dplyr functions i.e *arrange,filter, select, mutate and summarise*.
- All can be used in conjuction with `group_by()`.
- First arg is data frame, 2nd arg what to do with data, 3rd is a new data frame.

#### Filter rows with `filter()`.
- Used to subset observations.
- Example
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
- returns a new data frame, which you can save as usual
- to print and save, engulf it in ()

#### 4.3.1 Comparisons
Beware of using  == on floating numbers, eg math $sqrt(2)^2 == 2$ or $1/49 * 49 = 1$, by using $< 1e-6$ instead to check that you are close.

#### 4.3.2 Logical Operators
```r
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12) 
# is like  
filter(flights, month == 1)
```
- Use filter(flights, month %in% c(11,12))
- Complete set of boolean ![operations](boolean.png)
- De Morgan’s law: \!\(x & y\) is the same as \!x | \!y, and \!\(x | y\) is the same as \!x & \!y
- Example, to get flights that weren't delayed by more than two hours
```r
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
# or
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```
- R has both & and |,are vectorised. && and || are scalar operators.
- To find all rows after the first TRUE or all rows until FALSE.Use these cumulative functions;

```r
df <- data_frame(
        x = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE),
        y = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
filter(df, cumany(x)) # all rows after first TRUE
filter(df, cumall(y)) # all rows until first FALSE
```

#### 4.3.3 Missing values
- `filter()` only includes rows where condition is TRUE, it excludes both FALSE and NA values. If you want to preserve missing values,ask for them explicitly.
```{r}
df <- data_frame(x =c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x >1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

### 4.3.4 Exercises
- Find flights;
        * departed in summer
```{r}
summer <- filter(flights, month %in% c(6,7,8))
dim(summer) # 86995 Flights (Observations)
```
        * That flew to Houston \(IAH or HOU\)
```{r}
houston <- filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH","HOU"))
dim(houston) # 9313 Observations
```
        * There were operated by United, America or Delta
```{r}
usade <- filter(flights, carrier %in% c("US","AA","DL"))
dim(usade) # 101,375 flights
```
        * That were delayed by more than two hours
```{r}
delay2hr <- filter(flights, dep_delay >= 120 | arr_delay >=120)
dim(delay2hr) # 11,606 Flights
```
        * Arrived more than 2hours late, but didnt leave late.
```{r}
de2le0 <- filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120 & dep_delay <= 0)
dim(de2le0) # 29 flights
```
        * Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
```{r}
flig30 <- filter(flights,air_time >= 30)
flig1h30 <- filter(flig30, dep_delay >= 60 | arr_delay >= 60)

dim(flig1h30) # 31,932 flights delayed atleast an hour,but made over 30min flight
```
        * Departed between midnight and 6am
```{r}
mid6am <- filter(flights, hour >= 0 & hour <= 6)
dim(mid6am) # 27,905 flights left between 0 and 6am
```
        * Flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
```{r}
mis_dept <- filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
dim(mis_dept) # 8255 flights have NA as dep_time
```
- View\(mis\_dept\), dep\_delay,arr\_time, arr\_delay and air\_time are missing
- These could be canceled flights

### 4.4 Arrange rows with arrange()
- Works similarly to filter\(\), but instead of filtering/selecting,reorders them.
```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```
- Missing values always come at the end.
- baseR same `flights[order(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day), , drop = FALSE]`

Exercises
        * How could you use arrange\(\) to sort all missing values to the start?
```{r}
nas <- arrange(flights, desc(is.na(arr_delay))) #arr_delay begins with NAs
dim(nas)
```
        * Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.
```{r}
nas <- arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay + arr_delay)) 
sumbo <- flights$dep_delay + flights$arr_delay
nas_new <- sort(sumbo)
tail(nas_new) # Most delayed flight took 2573Minutes arr&dep (42.8hours,is it possible!!!)
head(nas_new,30) # Earliest was 100min ahead of schedule(both dep&arr)
# Did use arrange, though.
```

#### 4.5 select()
- Its not uncommon to get datasets with thousands of variables and face trouble of narrowing in on variables that you actually want.
- select\(\) arrows you to zoom in rapidly on a useful subset using operations based on names of the variables.

```r
select(flights, year, month, day) # Select col by name
select(flights, year:day) # select all col btwn year and day(inclusive)
selct(flights, -(year:day)) # select all col except from year to day(inclusive)
```
*Helper functions u can use with select()*
- starts\_with \("abc"\) , ends\_with \("xyz"\) , contains\("ijk"\), 
- matches\("(.\)\\"\) selects variables that match a regular expression. This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters.
- num\_range \("x", 1:3\) matches x1, x2 and x3.
- Its also possible to use select\(\) to rename variables.
`select(flights, tail_num = tailnum)`
- But coz select drops all other variables not explicitly mentioned, its not useful. Instead rename\(\), keeps variables by default.
`rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)`
- select\(\) function works similar to the select arg of base::subset().But dply select is a function on its own, which keeps functions small as dplyr philosophy.

##### Exercise
Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
```{r}
option1 <- select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```

#### 4.6 Add new variables with mutate()
- Its also often useful to add columns that are functions of existing columns.
- Mutate always adds new columns at the end of your dataset.
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights,
        year:day,
        ends_with("delay"),
        distance,
        air_time
)

mutate(flights_sml,
       gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
       speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```
- you can refer to columns in mutate that you just created up;
```r
mutate(flights_sml,
        gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
        hours = air_time / 60,
        gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```
- If you only want to keep the new variables, use transmute\(\)
```r
transmute(flights,
        gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
        hours = air_time / 60,
        gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```
#### 4.6.1 Useful functions
- Key property of mutate, is that the function for creating new variables must be vectorised. i.e it needs to return the same number of outputs as inputs. The list of functions, you can use is long, common ones are;
        * Arithmetic operators, +, -, *, /, ^. Note,These operations use “recycling rules” so if one parameter is shorter than the other, it will be automatically extended to be the same length.
        * Modular arithmetic, %/% integer division and %% remainder.where x == y * (x %/% y) + (x %% y)
```{r}
transmute(flights,
          dep_time,
          hour = dep_time %/% 100,
          minute = dep_time %% 100
)
```
        * Logs, log\(\),log2\(\), log10\(\). Logarithms are incredibly useful for dealing with data that ranges over multiple orders of magnitude. They convert multiplicative relationships to additive.
        All else being equal, I recommend using log2() because it’s easy to interpret: an difference of 1 on the log scale corresponds to doubling on the original scale and a difference of -1 corresponds to halving.
        * Offsets: lead\(\) and lag\(\) allow you to refer to leading or lagging values.This allows you to compute running differences e.g x - lag\(x\) or find when values change.
```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
lag(x)
lead(x)
```
       * Cumulative and rolling aggregates.R provides functions for running sums, products, mins and maxes: cumsum\(\), cumprod\(\), cummin\(\), cummax\(\). dplyr provides cummean\(\) for cumulative means. 
```{r}
x
cumsum(x)
cummean(x)
```
        * Logical comparisons <, <=, >, >=, != 
        * Ranking: there several ranking functions, but min_rank\(\). It does the usual ranking eg 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th. Use desc(x) to give largest values the smallest ranks.

```{r}
y <- c(1, 2, 2, NA, 3, 4)
data_frame(
  row_number(y),
  min_rank(y),
  dense_rank(y),
  percent_rank(y),
  cume_dist(y)
) %>% knitr::kable()
```

###### Exercises
        * Convert dep\_time and arr\_time to minutes since midnight?
```{r}
dep_arr <- select(flights, dep_time, arr_time)
dep_arr1 <- mutate(dep_arr, 
                   dep_min=(dep_time %/% 100)*60 + dep_time %% 100,
                   arr_min=(arr_time %/% 100)*60 + arr_time %% 100
)
head(dep_arr1)
```
        * Compute the scheduled time by adding dep\_delay to dep\_time. Plot the distribution of departure times. What do you think causes the interesting patter?
```{r}
scheduled_time <- transmute(flights, schedule_total = dep_delay + dep_time %/% 100 * 60 + dep_time %% 100)
ggplot(data = scheduled_time) +
        geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = schedule_total))
# Most flights below 4hr scheduled time are instead canceled
# No flights can be scheduled passd 24hours delay
```
        * Compare airtime with arr\_time - dep\_time. What do you expect to see? What do you see? Why?
```{r}
compare_airt <- transmute(flights,
                          air_t = (air_time %/% 100)*60 + air_time %% 100,
                          dep_min=(dep_time %/% 100)*60 + dep_time %% 100,
                          arr_min=(arr_time %/% 100)*60 + arr_time %% 100,
                          air_cal = arr_min - dep_min
)
comp_new <- select(compare_airt, air_t, air_cal)
ggplot(data = comp_new) +
        geom_point(mapping = aes(x = air_t, y =air_cal),na.rm = TRUE)
# It is not linear as I expected
# There are lots of plane with a calculated negative schedule time, which is shoddy.
# They record fec hours to have better flight history.
```

#### 4.7 Grouped summaries with summarise() 
The last verb is summarise\(\) . It collapses a dataframe to a single row.
```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```
- Better if used in pair with group_by\(\). e.g here we get average delay per date:
```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day) 
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) 
# calculates delay per 1day,2day,..,then 1month,2Month,... and 1year,.. as in the dataframe.
```

##### 4.7.1 Combining multiple operations with the pipe.
```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarise(by_dest,
                   count = n(),
                   dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
                   delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)

delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")

ggplot(delay, aes(dist, delay)) +
        geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
        geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
# Interesting it looks like delays increase with distance up to 
# ~750 miles and then decrease. Maybe as flights get longer there's
# more ability to make up delays in the air?
```
There are 3 steps to prepare the above data;
1. Group flights by destination
2. Summarise to compute distance, average delay, and number of flights
3. Filter to remove noisy points and Honolulu airport, which is almost twice as far away as the next closest aiport.
This code is a little frustrating to write because we have to give each intermediate data frame a name, even though we don’t care about it. Naming things well is hard, so this slows us down.
There’s another way to tackle the same problem with the pipe, %>%:

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
        group_by(dest) %>%
        summarise(
                count =n(),
                dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
                delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
        ) %>%
        filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")

#Behind the scenes, x %>% f(y) turns into f(x, y), and x %>% f(y) %>% g(z) turns into g(f(x, y), z) and so on.
```

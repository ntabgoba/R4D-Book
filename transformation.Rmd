> Create new variables, summaries, rename variables or reorder observations
*Examples are NYC departure flights 2013*, [source](www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0)

### 4.1 nycflights14
```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
flights
```
`View(flights)`,shows you the entire dataset like excel in viewer.
```{r}
class(flights)
```
- It prints diff coz it has diff class from usual dataframes.
- tbl\_df *tibble diff* or data\_frame
- `as.data_frame()` converts to tbl_df
- To create new tbl\_df from individual vectors,use data\_frame() eg
`data_frame(x=1:3, y=c("a", "b", "c"))`
- Subseting tbl\_df with [ always returns a tbl\_df, contrary to other that may give a vector.
- To extract a single column, use [[ or $.

### 4.2 dplyr verbs
- 5 dplyr functions i.e *arrange,filter, select, mutate and summarise*.
- All can be used in conjuction with `group_by()`.
- First arg is data frame, 2nd arg what to do with data, 3rd is a new data frame.

#### Filter rows with `filter()`.
- Used to subset observations.
- Example
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
- returns a new data frame, which you can save as usual
- to print and save, engulf it in ()

#### 4.3.1 Comparisons
Beware of using  == on floating numbers, eg math $sqrt(2)^2 == 2$ or $1/49 * 49 = 1$, by using $< 1e-6$ instead to check that you are close.

#### 4.3.2 Logical Operators
```r
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12) 
# is like  
filter(flights, month == 1)
```
- Use filter(flights, month %in% c(11,12))
- Complete set of boolean ![operations](boolean.png)
- De Morganâ€™s law: \!\(x & y\) is the same as \!x | \!y, and \!\(x | y\) is the same as \!x & \!y
- Example, to get flights that weren't delayed by more than two hours
```r
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
# or
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```
- R has both & and |,are vectorised. && and || are scalar operators.
- To find all rows after the first TRUE or all rows until FALSE.Use these cumulative functions;

```r
df <- data_frame(
        x = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE),
        y = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
filter(df, cumany(x)) # all rows after first TRUE
filter(df, cumall(y)) # all rows until first FALSE
```

#### 4.3.3 Missing values
- `filter()` only includes rows where condition is TRUE, it excludes both FALSE and NA values. If you want to preserve missing values,ask for them explicitly.
```{r}
df <- data_frame(x =c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x >1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

### 4.3.4 Exercises
- Find flights;
        * departed in summer
```{r}
summer <- filter(flights, month %in% c(6,7,8))
dim(summer) # 86995 Flights (Observations)
```
        * That flew to Houston \(IAH or HOU\)
```{r}
houston <- filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH","HOU"))
dim(houston) # 9313 Observations
```
        * There were operated by United, America or Delta
```{r}
usade <- filter(flights, carrier %in% c("US","AA","DL"))
dim(usade) # 101,375 flights
```
        * That were delayed by more than two hours
```{r}
delay2hr <- filter(flights, dep_delay >= 120 | arr_delay >=120)
dim(delay2hr) # 11,606 Flights
```
        * Arrived more than 2hours late, but didnt leave late.
```{r}
de2le0 <- filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120 & dep_delay <= 0)
dim(de2le0) # 29 flights
```
        * Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
```{r}
flig30 <- filter(flights,air_time >= 30)
flig1h30 <- filter(flig30, dep_delay >= 60 | arr_delay >= 60)

dim(flig1h30) # 31,932 flights delayed atleast an hour,but made over 30min flight
```
        * Departed between midnight and 6am
```{r}
mid6am <- filter(flights, hour >= 0 & hour <= 6)
dim(mid6am) # 27,905 flights left between 0 and 6am
```
        * Flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
```{r}
mis_dept <- filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
dim(mis_dept) # 8255 flights have NA as dep_time
```
- View\(mis\_dept\), dep\_delay,arr\_time, arr\_delay and air\_time are missing
- These could be canceled flights

### 4.4 Arrange rows with arrange()
- Works similarly to filter\(\), but instead of filtering/selecting,reorders them.
```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```
- Missing values always come at the end.
- baseR same `flights[order(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day), , drop = FALSE]`

Exercises
        * How could you use arrange\(\) to sort all missing values to the start?
```{r}
nas <- arrange(flights, desc(is.na(arr_delay))) #arr_delay begins with NAs
dim(nas)
```
        * Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.
```{r}
nas <- arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay + arr_delay)) 
sumbo <- flights$dep_delay + flights$arr_delay
nas_new <- sort(sumbo)
tail(nas_new) # Most delayed flight took 2573Minutes arr&dep (42.8hours,is it possible!!!)
head(nas_new,30) # Earliest was 100min ahead of schedule(both dep&arr)
# Did use arrange, though.
```

#### 4.5 select()
- Its not uncommon to get datasets with thousands of variables and face trouble of narrowing in on variables that you actually want.
- select\(\) arrows you to zoom in rapidly on a useful subset using operations based on names of the variables.

```r
select(flights, year, month, day) # Select col by name
select(flights, year:day) # select all col btwn year and day(inclusive)
selct(flights, -(year:day)) # select all col except from year to day(inclusive)
```
*Helper functions u can use with select()*
- starts\_with \("abc"\) , ends\_with \("xyz"\) , contains\("ijk"\), 
- matches\("(.\)\\"\) selects variables that match a regular expression. This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters.
- num\_range \("x", 1:3\) matches x1, x2 and x3.
- Its also possible to use select\(\) to rename variables.
`select(flights, tail_num = tailnum)`
- But coz select drops all other variables not explicitly mentioned, its not useful. Instead rename\(\), keeps variables by default.
`rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)`
- select\(\) function works similar to the select arg of base::subset().But dply select is a function on its own, which keeps functions small as dplyr philosophy.

##### Exercise
Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
```{r}
option1 <- select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```

#### 4.6 Add new variables with mutate()
- Its also often useful to add columns that are functions of existing columns.
- Mutate always adds new columns at the end of your dataset.
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights,
        year:day,
        ends_with("delay"),
        distance,
        air_time
)

mutate(flights_sml,
       gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
       speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```
- you can refer to columns in mutate that you just created up;
```r
mutate(flights_sml,
        gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
        hours = air_time / 60,
        gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```
- If you only want to keep the new variables, use transmute\(\)
```r
transmute(flights,
        gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
        hours = air_time / 60,
        gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```
